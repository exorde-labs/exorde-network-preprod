Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish Nobel Prize chemist, conducted in 1896 the first study to link CO2 emissions with a global warming as we know it today.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>More than 100 years have gone by since, and yet it is only today we are starting to see real change in our societies with regards to this issue. So, what happened?</strong></p>\n<p>First and foremost, studies continued being carried out on this subject, although the scientific methods used to conduct these were not always reliable at least until the 1850s when methodical thermometer-based records began. Even after that period of time, many records had to be wiped due to bad m easurements.</p>\n<p>Over the years, it has become several studies have been conducted, strengthening the idea that global warming is in part linked to an increase of CO2 emissions. However, conflicting information reached the public with regards to the subject. As the subject started to arise time and time again, several prominent personalities started commenting on it a major deception (1996), : calling it a scam (2007), and a hoax (2016).</p>\n<p>Even to this day, recent articles come up regularly stating that there is no climate emergency (2021). This goes directly against an established scientific consensus amongst climate researchers of 97-98% further hindering the political response to the situation.</p>\n<p>Our failure to act on this subject earlier is already the cause of increasing droughts, increasing wildfires &#x26; forest regeneration, increased hurricane damage and more.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Promoting quality journalism backed by scientific evidence</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whereas it is becoming increasingly clear today that there is a direct correlation between human-based CO2 emissions and global warming, this remains a hot topic to this day. Exorde aims to restore the balance in the discussion by promoting quality journalism backed by scientific evidence, and delivering trust scores on climate-change related issues to help Web users remain critical with regards to the information they encounter.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Global warming","thumbnail":"/img/pexels-jeffrey-czum-5792506-1.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"localizedSlug":"/use-cases/global-warming","locale":"en","canonical":true,"alternatePages":[{"slug":"/fr/use-cases/global-warming","locale":"fr"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3897982121"]}
