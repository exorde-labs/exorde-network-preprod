So, what happened?</strong></p>\n<p>First and foremost, studies continued being carried out on this subject, although the scientific methods used to conduct these were not always reliable at least until the 1850s when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_temperature_record\">methodical thermometer-based records began</a>. Even after that period of time, many records had to be wiped due to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/12/what-old-weather-reports-dont-reveal-about-climate-change/419850/\">bad measurements</a>.</p>\n<p>Over the years, it has become several studies have been conducted, strengthening the idea that <a href=\"https://history.aip.org/climate/timeline.htm\">global warming is in part linked to an increase of CO2 emissions</a>. However, conflicting information reached the public with regards to the subject. As the subject started to arise time and time again, several prominent personalities started commenting on it a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB834512411338954000\">major deception</a> (1996), <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/media-blog/weather-channel-boss-calls-global-warming-greatest-scam-history-tom-gross/\">calling it a scam</a> (2007), and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/world/asia/china-trump-climate-change.html\">a hoax</a> (2016).</p>\n<p>Even to this day, recent articles come up regularly stating that <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/apr/21/there-is-no-climate-emergency/\">there is no climate emergency</a> (2021). This goes directly against <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/06/04/1003187107\">an established scientific consensus amongst climate researchers of 97-98%</a> further hindering the political response to the situation.</p>\n<p>Our failure to act on this subject earlier is already the cause of <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/4/044012/pdf\">increasing droughts</a>, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1111/ele.12889\">increasing wildfires &#x26; forest regeneration</a>, <a href=\"www.rescuethatfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Dinan-2017.pdf\">increased hurricane damage</a> and more.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Promoting quality journalism backed by scientific evidence</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whereas it is becoming increasingly clear today that there is a direct correlation between human-based CO2 emissions and global warming, this remains a hot topic to this day. Exorde aims to restore the balance in the discussion by promoting quality journalism backed by scientific evidence, and delivering trust scores on climate-change related issues to help Web users remain critical with regards to the information they encounter.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Global warming.","thumbnail":"/img/pexels-jeffrey-czum-5792506-1.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"localizedSlug":"/use-cases/global-warming","locale":"en","canonical":true,"alternatePages":[{"slug":"/fr/use-cases/global-warming","locale":"fr"},{"slug":"/fr/use-cases/global-warming","locale":"fr"},{"slug":"/fr/use-cases/global-warming","locale":"fr"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3897982121"]}
